# Health Check Command

## Trigger
When user types `<Health-Check>` or automatically at session start

## Process

1. **Check Message Count**
   - Count messages in current conversation
   - Update health status based on thresholds:
     - 0-30 messages: 游릭 Healthy
     - 31-45 messages: 游리 Approaching limits
     - 46+ messages: 游댮 Handover recommended

   ```

3. **Update Session State**
   - Save current state to `.claude/session/current-session.yaml`
   - Include timestamp of last update

4. **Warnings and Recommendations**
   - If 游리: Suggest completing current unit of work
