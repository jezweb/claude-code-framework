## Overview

This guide helps teams transition from [Current Framework/Process] to the Claude Code Framework while preserving existing workflows where beneficial.

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Assessment (Week 1)
- [ ] Run `./scripts/customize-framework.sh`
- [ ] Review generated configurations
- [ ] Identify gaps between current and new practices
- [ ] Create migration plan

### Phase 2: Pilot (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Select pilot project/feature
- [ ] Apply Claude Code practices
- [ ] Document pain points
- [ ] Adjust configurations

### Phase 3: Rollout (Week 4+)
- [ ] Train team on new practices
- [ ] Migrate active projects
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Monitor adoption

## Mapping Current Practices

### Code Style Migration
| Current Practice | Claude Code Equivalent | Action Required |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| [Your style guide] | `.claude/best_practices/[tech]-best-practices.md` | [Customize/Adopt] |
| [Your linter config] | See language-specific practices | [Migrate settings] |
| [Your formatter] | Configurable per language | [Update config] |

### Workflow Migration
| Current Process | Claude Code Process | Migration Steps |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [Your branching] | Configurable in workflow-config.yaml | [Steps] |
| [Your review process] | Team-configurable | [Steps] |
| [Your deployment] | Flexible deployment practices | [Steps] |

### Testing Migration
| Current Testing | Claude Code Testing | Changes Needed |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| [Your test framework] | Language-specific recommendations | [What changes] |
| [Your coverage] | Configurable minimums | [Adjust targets] |
| [Your test structure] | Best practice guidelines | [Restructure if needed] |

## Preserving Current Strengths

### What to Keep
List practices from your current framework that work well:
1. [Good practice 1] - Add to customizations
2. [Good practice 2] - Document in team config
3. [Good practice 3] - Create addendum

### How to Integrate
```yaml
# In team-config.yaml
custom:
  preserved_practices:
    - name: "[Practice name]"
      description: "[Why we keep this]"
      implementation: "[How it fits]"
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: [Describe common issue]
**Solution**: [How to address it]
**Example**: [Code or config example]

### Challenge 2: Different File Structure
**Solution**: Gradually migrate structure
**Steps**:
1. Keep current structure initially
2. Document in team config
3. Migrate module by module

### Challenge 3: Tool Differences
**Current Tool** → **Claude Code Alternative**
- [Tool 1] → [Alternative or integration]
- [Tool 2] → [Alternative or integration]

## Integration Checklist

### Repository Setup
- [ ] Add `.claude/` directory
- [ ] Run customization script
- [ ] Copy relevant templates
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` if needed

### Configuration Files
- [ ] Migrate linter configs to best practices
- [ ] Update CI/CD configs
- [ ] Adapt test configurations
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks

### Team Preparation
- [ ] Share customization summary
- [ ] Schedule training session
- [ ] Update onboarding docs
- [ ] Create quick reference guide

### Gradual Adoption
- [ ] Start with new features
- [ ] Migrate during refactoring
- [ ] Update during bug fixes
- [ ] Full adoption timeline: [date]

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Keep original configs in `[backup-location]`
2. Revert process: [steps]
3. Escalation: [who to contact]

## Success Metrics

Track adoption success:
- [ ] Code quality metrics
- [ ] Team satisfaction survey
- [ ] Development velocity
- [ ] Defect rates

## FAQs

### Q: Do we have to adopt everything at once?
A: No, the framework is designed for gradual adoption. Start with what makes sense for your team.

### Q: Can we keep our current [specific tool/process]?
A: Yes, document it in your team configuration and create an addendum explaining how it integrates.

### Q: What if Claude Code practices conflict with company policy?
